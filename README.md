## Overview

The **Circular Economy (CE) Ecosystem Viewer** is an interactive web application designed to visualize and explore the innovation ecosystems of three pilot regions: **Hamburg** (Germany), **Novi Sad** (Serbia), and **Cahul** (Moldova).

This tool allows stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers to discover entities involved in Circular Economy activities, understand their relationships, identify gaps and synergies, and foster collaboration across the ecosystem.

This project is part of the **AI-InnoScEnCE** initiative (Work Package 4).

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Ecosystem Dashboard**: High-level statistics and distribution of entities by role (Startups, Academia, Industry, etc.).
-   **Entity Browser**: Filterable list of ecosystem actors with detailed profiles, capabilities, and needs.
-   **Interactive Map**: Geospatial visualization of entities to identify regional clusters.
-   **Partnership Graph**: Network visualization showing existing collaborations and potential synergies.
-   **Collaboration Finder**: Targeted search for specific CE capabilities and needs within the ecosystem.
-   **Insights Engine**: Automated analysis identifying gaps, recommendations, and cross-cluster opportunities.
